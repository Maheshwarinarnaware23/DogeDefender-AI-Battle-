"Grok 3 vs. ChatGPT vs. DeepSeek in an Asteroids-style showdown!"

Welcome to Doge Defender, a simple HTML5 game inspired by the 1979 arcade classic Asteroids. I tasked three AI models—Grok 3 (xAI), ChatGPT (OpenAI), and DeepSeek—to build it with the same prompt. Spoiler: Grok 3 crushed it, needing the least tweaks for a smooth, efficient result. Try it, compare the code, and see for yourself!

The Game
Objective: Shoot enemies, collect power-ups, and rack up a score in billions of dollars!
Controls: Arrow keys to move, Spacebar to shoot.
Mechanics: 
Enemies chase you.
Power-ups add extra bullets per shot.
Score $10M per enemy; win at $1B.
Lose? Press 'R' to restart.
Files: index.html, game.js, hero.png, enemy.png, powerup.png, shoot.wav, music.mp3.

How to Play
Open index.html in a modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.).
Dodge, shoot, and aim for $1B!

Note: You’ll need the 5 asset files (listed above) in the same directory. Placeholder assets work if you don’t have custom ones—swap in your own Doge-themed PNGs and sounds!
The AI Battle
I gave each AI the same prompt: build "Doge Defender" with minimal files and specific mechanics. Here’s how they stacked up:
Grok 3: The champ! Delivered clean, functional code with almost no edits needed. Stuck to the brief, no fluff—pure efficiency.
ChatGPT: Solid effort, but added extra effects I didn’t ask for. Needed more trimming to match the spec.
DeepSeek: Decent, but required several fixes—logic bugs and stray features slowed it down.
Check the code in game.js (Grok 3’s version here) and the ai-versions/ folder for ChatGPT and DeepSeek attempts (if you include them).

Why Grok 3 Won
Minimal Edits: Worked near-perfectly out of the box.
Accuracy: Nailed the 5-file limit and $B scoring without overcomplicating.
Speed: Fastest to get running—less debugging, more playing.
